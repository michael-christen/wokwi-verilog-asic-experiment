# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "Michael Christen"      # Your name
  title:        "An optionally cumulative adder"      # Project title
  description:  "Increment with clock and add previous result or current A + B"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "A, B are 3 bits, there's a clock and a selctor to use A or (A + B)'"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Toggle clock to run increment, swap between acumulating or just adding with switch 2; 3-5 are A, 6-8 are B"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "LEDs and switches would be handy"      # Describe any external hardware needed
